## Tic-Tac-Toe Monte Carlo RL

A simple reinforcement learning project demonstrating Monte Carlo policy evaluation and one-step greedy policy improvement for Tic-Tac-Toe.

### Features

- Simulates Tic-Tac-Toe games with a random or improved agent.

- Estimates state values using first-visit Monte Carlo.

- Improves policy by choosing actions that maximize expected returns.

- Evaluates performance with win/draw/loss statistics.

### Usage
`./not_sus_run_me.ps1`


The script will:

1. Estimate state values under a random policy.

2. Compare random vs. improved policy performance.

### Dependencies

All dependencies are managed by the uv.lock file and are installed/removed by the .ps1 file.
